## Featured Projects

### **Prompt to Video and Audio Math Visualization Teacher with Agentic AI**
**Area of Research:** Agentic AI, Generative AI, LLM, Math, Education
<br>**Languages + Frameworks:** Python + HTML  + OpenAI API
* Locally hosted website takes in prompt and generates 25-45 second educational video to visualize and explain math intuitively
* Leverages Manim to render mathematical animations, OpenAI TTS for audio narration
* OpenAI agentic AI uses GPT 5 to:
  * Write structured Manim JSON, then critique/rewrite code to minimize syntax error
  * Develop teaching strategy
  * Generate video with subtitles + generate audio narration overlay with subtitles
  * Read logs and repair code on syntax error
* Includes code sanitization, and extensive system/user prompts to maximize success and feature compliance

### **Handwritten Digit Classification with Backpropagation from Scratch**
**Area of Research:** Deep learning, Supervised Learning, Image Classification
<br>**Languages + Frameworks:** C# + Unity 
* Implemented a custom fully parameterized feedforward neural network + backpropagation without the use of ML libraries to understand low-level details of deep learning
* Complete supervised training loop with data shuffling, mini-batch gradient descent, adaptive learning-rate decay, and in-editor logging of loss/accuracy
* Built a Unity-based workflow with CSV normalization, one-hot encoding, textured digit previews and evaluation metrics for both training and testing

### **Volumetric Cloud Simulation with Compute Shaders**
**Area of Research:** 3D Graphics, Compute Shaders, Parallelization, Natural Science
<br>**Languages + Frameworks:** C# + HLSL + Unity
* Real-time volumetric ray-marching renderer models the diffusion of light through clouds 
* Leverages compute shaders to parallelize noise generation and density sampling to allow real-time rendering for game development use-cases
* Procedurally generates 3D Worley noise volume and 2D Perlin density textures for realistic, seeded, infinitely tileable cloud structure
* Highly customizable and dynamic clouds: parameters affect wind, coverage, density, light scattering behaviour, level of detail

### **Procedural Island Mesh Generation**
**Area of Research:** 3D Graphics, Game Development, Noise Generation
<br>**Languages + Frameworks:** C# + Shader Graph + Unity
* Configurable multi-octave perlin noise to generate mesh heightmap
* Noise sampling, biome classification, gradient-based colorization and custom shader builds realistic islands with physics-based mesh for game development or ML training environments

### **Game of Life and Temperature Diffusion with Cellular Automata**
**Area of Research:** Iterative Solver, Cellular Automata, Emergent Behaviour
<br>**Languages + Frameworks:** C# + Unity
* Implemented Guass-Seidel iterative solver to simulate the heat propagation and convection of gas
* Used the same cellular automata system to simulate emergent behaviour in Conway's Game of Life
* 2D texel grid encodes information and cell states evolve according to adjacent states and rules
