## Featured Projects

### **Prompt to Video and Audio Math Visualization Teacher with Agentic AI**
**Python + HTML**  
* Teaching assistant to visualize and explain math intuitively
* Locally hosted website takes in prompt and generates 25-45 second teaching video
* Leverages Manim to render mathematical animations, OpenAI TTS for audio narration
* OpenAI agentic AI uses GPT 5 to:
  * Write Manim code, then critique/rewrite code to minimize syntax error
  * Develop teaching strategy
  * Generate video with subtitles + generate audio narration overlay
  * Read logs and regenerate code on syntax error

### **Handwritten Digit Classification with Backpropagation from Scratch**
**C# + Unity**  
* Implemented a custom fully parameterized feedforward neural network + backpropagation without the use of ML libraries to understand low-level details of deep learning
* Complete supervised training loop with data shuffling, mini-batch gradient descent, adaptive learning-rate decay, and in-editor logging of loss/accuracy
* Built a Unity-based workflow with CSV normalization, one-hot encoding, textured digit previews and evaluation metrics for both training and testing
